Analyze Cloud-Native.

## 1. Cloud-Native

Cloud-Native means **an approach to developing and operating Apps that maximizes the benefits of Cloud environments**. The benefits of Cloud environments mentioned here are scalability and flexibility. Through IaaS, Compute, Network, and Storage resources can be easily allocated and used as needed. Through Container technology, Apps can maintain independent environments for each App while being quickly deployed to each Compute resource.

The Architecture that maximizes the scalability and flexibility of Cloud is MSA (Micro Service Architecture). In MSA, App functionalities are divided into multiple small Services. App functionalities shown to users are composed of combinations of multiple Services. In MSA, when load concentrates on a specific Service, Load Balancing can be easily performed through Scale Out of only that Service. Also, flexible CD (Continuous Deployment) is possible by updating only specific Services while keeping the App running. Because of this App flexibility, Cloud-Native Apps use MSA.
