title: Concurrency, Parallelism
---

Compare Concurrency and Parallelism which have similar meanings.

## 1. Concurrency (병행성)

Concurrency is a **property of programs**. If a program or algorithm is divided into multiple parts and processed simultaneously, it is said to be Concurrent. Even if Concurrent programs or algorithms operate on a Single Core CPU, they must manage shared resources through Lock to perform normal operations.

## 2. Parallelism (병렬성)

Parallelism is a **property of machines**. Programming techniques like CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI are techniques that utilize multiple Cores that actual CPUs or GPUs have. Therefore, they are called parallel programming techniques.
