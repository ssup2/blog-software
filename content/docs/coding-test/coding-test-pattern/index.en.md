## 1. Backtracking

* Example Problems

## 2. Dynamic Programming

* Example Problems

## 3. Binary Tree Traversal

* Example Problems

## 4. DFS, BFS

* Example Problems

## 5. Top K Elements

* Example Problems

## 6. Prefix Sum

* Example Problems

## 7. Sliding Window

* Useful pattern for finding consecutive subarrays
* Can reduce time complexity from `O(n * k)` to `O(n)` compared to brute force (`k` is the size of the subarray)
* Generally uses `start_index` and `end_index` to represent the start and end of the window
* Example Problems
  * [LeetCode / Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](../../coding-test/leetcode-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## 8. Two Pointers

* Pattern where two pointers move toward each other or in opposite directions while searching
* Can reduce time complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)` compared to brute force
* Example Problems
  * [LeetCode / Container With Most Water](../../coding-test/leetcode-container-with-most-water/)

## 9. Fast and Slow Pointers

* Example Problems

## 10. Modified Binary Search

* Example Problems

## 11. Monotonic Stack

* Example Problems

## 12. Linked List In-Place Reversal

* Example Problems

## 13. Overlapping Intervals

* Example Problems
