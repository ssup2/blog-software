## Getting Started

As cloud environments become more widespread, containers have become an essential technology for people working in software. For DevOps engineers, containers have become a technology that must be learned. Even for software developers, the environment has changed to require some level of container handling. People who are new to containers can easily use containers with Docker. However, simply having experience with Docker alone makes it difficult to deeply understand containers. Containers are composed of a combination of various Linux kernel features, and there are many constituent features, and each feature is mostly an advanced Linux kernel function, making it difficult for people who don't know Linux well to understand.

This article is structured to help understand containers by introducing the Linux kernel features that make up containers one by one. After the basic container explanation is finished, through analysis of Docker, a representative container management tool, and Kubernetes, which is widely used as a container orchestrator, it introduces how containers are actually applied and used. Finally, through comparison with VMs, which are often compared with containers, it is structured to understand the advantages and disadvantages of containers. All processes are structured so that readers can see with their own eyes through hands-on practice, allowing readers to learn containers with their bodies.
